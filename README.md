# Project Description

Raw implementation of the paper From Paper to Machine: Extracting Strokes from Images for use in Sketch Recognition (http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/hammond/publications/pdf/2008RajanSBIM.pdf). 
The aim of this project is to create an algorithm capable of segmenting a set of strokes, taking into account some of the natural steps followed by a human while drawing.
